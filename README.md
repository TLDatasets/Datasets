# Datasets
Datasets for Transfer Learning algorithms.
For each dataset, 2 csv files are included - one for the source data and another for the target data.
For example, for the CreditAU dataset, the file "CreditAUSourcedata.csv" contains the source dataset whereas  "CreditAUTargetdata.csv" contains the target dataset.
